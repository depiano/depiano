### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I graduated with honors in Computer Science at the University of Salerno. 
I won two research grants in the IT field (2018-2020). 
I really like the new technologies and methodologies used in software development.
I am very skilled in Java SE/EE, Java RMI, Angular6+, HTML5/CCS3/JS, TypeScript, SQL, MongoDB, Ionic5+ and PHP7+.
I am able to work back-end and front-end.
